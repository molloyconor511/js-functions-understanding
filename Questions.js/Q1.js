/* What's the value of result after calling this function? Why?
function myFunction(num1, num2) {
    return num1+num2
};
const result = myFunction(5, 5);

This is declaring a function called `myFunction` with 2 arguments and returns the sum of those 2 numbers.
Variable `result` is defined which is equal to the outcome of runing that function with each parameter qual to 5 so expected outcome is 10.
